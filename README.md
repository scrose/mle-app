# Mountain Legacy Explorer (MLE) Application

----------------

## Overview

The Mountain Legacy Explorer (MLE) app is a web-based frontend interface designed to provide users with an intuitive and interactive way to explore the Mountain Legacy Project's (MLP) collection of historic and modern survey images.

### Mountain Legacy Project (MLP)

 The [Mountain Legacy Project](http://mountainlegacy.ca/) at the University of Victoria supports numerous research initiatives exploring the use of repeat photography to study ecosystem, landscape, and anthropogenic changes. MLP hosts the largest systematic collection of mountain photographs, with over 120,000 high-resolution historic (grayscale) survey photographs of Canadaâ€™s Western mountains captured from the 1880s through the 1950s, with over 9,000 corresponding modern (colour) repeat images. Over the years, the MLP has built a suite of custom tools for the classification and analysis of images in the collection (Gat et al. 2011; Jean et al. 2015b; Sanseverino et al. 2016). 

## Features
------------

*   **Image Browser**: Browse through the MLP's collection of over 120,000 high-resolution historic mountain photographs.
*   **Image Pairs**: View repeat photo pairs to visualize changes in the mountain landscape over time.
*   **Metadata Access**: Access related metadata for each image, including location, date, and photographer information.
*   **Search and Filter**: Search and filter images by location, date, and other criteria to quickly find specific images.

## Technology Stack
--------------------

*   **Frontend**: Built using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Backend**: Integrated with the MLE API, which provides access to the MLP's image collection and metadata.
